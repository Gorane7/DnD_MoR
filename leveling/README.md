# Changes to class level up system.
### Abstract
According to the original 5e ruleset, characters would gain XP, which would get them levels, which they could in turn spend on certain classes.
This makes sense for stuff like gaining spell slots or getting an extra attack (you get more powerful as you fight), but not so much when it comes to stuff like learning new spells or Ability Score Improvements (how can you suddenly know a new spell, or why should your charisma increase after blasting your way through a dungeon).
These changes aim to separate the leveling system to two separate concepts: fighting, which gives you xp and training or learning, which allows you to learn new spells or practice certain aspects of your character (ASI or feats).
