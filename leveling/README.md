# Changes to class level up system.
### Abstract
According to the original 5e ruleset, characters would gain XP, which would get them levels, which they could in turn spend on certain classes.
This makes sense for stuff like gaining spell slots or getting an extra attack (you get more powerful as you fight), but not so much when it comes to stuff like learning new spells or Ability Score Improvements (how can you suddenly know a new spell, or why should your charisma increase after blasting your way through a dungeon).
These changes aim to separate the leveling system to two separate concepts: fighting, which gives you xp and training or learning, which allows you to learn new spells or practice certain aspects of your character (ASI or feats).

### Skill trees
In original 5e there are 9 different classes (10 if you count artificer) and the possibility to multiclass to have levels in several classes. To gain a level in a class, you however still need to get enough XP to reach an amount determined by your total level (sum of levels in each class). Another way to view this system, is by having XP and reaching certain milestones with said XP, will give you a "class point", which you can spend to increase your level in any class. Classes can in turn be viewed as linear skill trees. MoR aims to embrace this view of classes as skill trees and trims unnecessary abilities out of classes into their own separate skill trees. Because of this, each class level gives you less progression and there are more levels needed for abilities out of class skill trees, so level-ups are more frequent. This hopefully allows for a more customizable character while still retaining the feeling of separate classes.
